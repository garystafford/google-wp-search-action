# Programmatic Ponderings Search Action for Google Assistant

This project was created for the post, [Integrating Search Capabilities with Actions for Google Assistant, using GKE and Elasticsearch](https://wp.me/p1RD28-603). This two-part post explores the enhancement of voice and text-based conversational interfaces by integrating a search and analytics engine. By interfacing an Action for Google Assistant conversational interface with Elasticsearch, we will improve the Action’s ability to provide relevant results to the end-user.

This repository contains the Action's serverless Cloud Function, detailed in the post, which communicates with Elasticsearch, via the [Spring Boot Service](https://github.com/garystafford/spring-wp-search).
